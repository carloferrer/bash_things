# bash_things
Script and alias all the things; work smart, not hard.

### Setup
- Clone this repo somewhere (we'll call this directory path `~/bash_things`).
- Append this to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`:

```sh
for bash_thing in ~/bash_things/*.sh ; do source $bash_thing ; done
```

### Notes
- This repo's mostly just for me, but you're free to use it.
- A few of the scripts/aliases reference non-native tools (e.g., `yarn`).
